Hello,
we are Kaitlyn and (Eu)Gene, and we live in our self-converted Promaster campervan.

**Kaitlyn**

This is where kaitlyn gets to tell us about herself.

**Eugene**

I'm Eugene, but everyone calls me "Gene". I have grown up traveling around the world and I've always loved to seek adventures. Shortly after graduating high school I joined the Army where I learned the skills required to work in IT. After leaving the Army, I pursued a career in Network Engineering, which lead to an opportunity in Seattle Washington, which is where we now call "home". I chose to take on the challenge of self-building a campervan. It was never the easy path since I had zero skills in any field that would benefit our build process, but I often say I am a graduate of YouTube University. Now I am a full time traveler, exploring the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

**Kevan**

Our van Kevan is a self-converted campervan. The name Kevan came from our names, the "K" from Kaitlyn, the "E" from Eugene, and the "van" from Promaster cargo van.

It is a 2018 Promaster 3500 Extended. When we bought Kevan, he had 900 miles on the odometer, and was an empty cargo van. Now Kevan is a full-fledged RV complete with a fixed bed, kitchen with running water and a propane range, a bathroom complete with a shower and toilet, and even a dining area.

We have 400ah of Lithium, 500 Watts of solar, a 2000 Watt inverter/charger, and a 60amp battery-to-battery charger.

We like to say we have all the unicorns of "#vanlife", toilet, shower, heater, and even 12v air conditioning that we could technically run for short periods (1-2 hours) solely on solar.
