Hello,
we are Kaitlyn and (Eu)Gene, and we live in our self-converted Promaster campervan.


## Kaitlyn

I am Kaitlyn! I was born and raised in Utah. I am a voracious consumer of anything true crime and a compulsive apologizer (sorry). I love pizza, Kraft mac & cheese, cinnamon rolls, comedy, movies, music, games, writing, traveling, and sports. One day in high school, a cute new boy named Gene showed up to class, and now I get to call him my husband. I caught the travel bug after a trip to London, and realized that I hadnâ€™t seen very much of my own country. Years of dreaming and planning later, I regularly find myself in total amazement at this life we have created for ourselves and these new memories we are making every single day.



## Eugene

I'm Eugene, but everyone calls me "Gene". I have grown up traveling around the world and I've always loved to seek adventures. Shortly after graduating high school I joined the Army where I learned the skills required to work in IT. After leaving the Army, I pursued a career in Network Engineering, which lead to an opportunity in Seattle Washington, which is where we now call "home". I chose to take on the challenge of self-building a campervan. It was never the easy path since I had zero skills in any field that would benefit our build process, but I often say I am a graduate of YouTube University. Now I am a full time traveler, exploring the United States, Canada, and Mexico.


## Kevan

Our van Kevan is a self-converted campervan. The name Kevan came from our names, the "K" from Kaitlyn, the "E" from Eugene, and the "van" because, well, you get it.

Kevan is a 2018 Promaster 3500 Extended. When we bought Kevan, he had 900 miles on the odometer, and was an empty cargo van. Now Kevan is a full-fledged RV complete with a fixed bed, kitchen with running water and a propane range, a bathroom complete with a shower and toilet, and even a dining area/desk space.

We like to say we have all the unicorns of "#vanlife", toilet, shower, heater, and even 12v air conditioning that we could technically run for short periods (1-2 hours) solely on solar.



### FAQ

|Question|Answer|
|----------|----------|
|How long have you been on the road? | We officially hit the road October 28, 2020. |
|How long did it take you to build your van out? | We bought Kevan new on the lot in November of 2019, but didn't really start building until January of 2020. When I (Gene) left my job in June, the progress really took off. We were able to complete about 80% of the build before our apartment lease in Seattle, WA ran out and we traveled back to Utah to finish it a week or so before we officially hit the road. <br><br> About 10 Months|
|How many Watts Solar do you have? |500W, 5x 100Watt Renogy panels mounted on the roof|
|What kind of batteries do you have? |4x Renogy 100Amp Smart Lithium Batteries for 400AH total storage|
|How much Water do you have?|We have a 46Gal fresh water tank mounted in the garage, we can fill it most of the way before it spills out, I'd estimate about 42Gal of water|
|Where do you poop/shower? | We have a Natures Head composting toilet, but we use public bathrooms whenever possible, and we built a shower into our van so we can shower wherever we need to, but again prefer public bathrooms (like Planet Fitness)|
|What king of gas mileage do you get? | We average around 13-14mpg, the most we've ever seen was just under 16mpg. We have a very heavy build (just shy of 9,000 lbs) and we have larger size tires than stock. |
|Do you have heat/AC? | Yes, we have an Espar B2 Gasoline heater directly connected to Kevan's gas tank, and we installed a Cruise N Comfort 12v air conditioner (we haven't used it since installing it)
