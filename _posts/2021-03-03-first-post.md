Hello and welcome to our first blog post. When we set out on our journey in Kevan we did it with the thought that we would be forging memories for years to come. We think that writing down and possibly sharing those memories would be a good way to ensure we never forget the adventures we have been on.

Today I (Gene) am working on our website with limited internet connectivity, in Craggy Wash just outside of Lake Havasu City. We are gathered up here with several of our friends from the road as we attempt to support Nelson building out his new bus.

The weather has been amazing most days, but there have been two days now (Today being one of them) that kept us locked in our van avoiding the wind.



## Full Moon Circle

- When we arrived at this locaiton we learned of a planned Full Moon Circle. Having never been and never having heard of, we knew we needed to go.
- We arrived to the evening festivities after dark, with just a blanket to sit on. We found our spot in the circle and got comfortable-ish.
- To begin we took turns around the circle stating our intention for the night. (Kaitlyn and I basically stated the same intention "open-mindedness")
- To open the circle one of the members of our group shared with us a native ritual looking west/north/east/south, then up to the sky and down connecting with the ground.
- Next we went on a guided meditation to the bottom of the ocean to see what turned up, all while reiki was performed and a singing bowl was used.
- After we returned from the bottom of the ocean, we did another medidtation to find our spirit animal/totem.
- Then the evening was completed with sound therapy provided by a gong. Did you know there are different sounds produced by a single gong? We didn't.
- It was cold, we wanted to go to sleep, so we took our leave, cranked up the heat inside Kevan and drifted off to sleep.
